Statistics::FactorAnalysis version 0.0.2

DESCRIPTION

Factor analysis is a statistical method by which the variability of a large set of observed variables is described in
terms of a smaller set of unobserved variables termed factors. Factor analysis uses the premise that data observed from
such a large number of variables are in some way a function of these factors that cannot be measured directly.
The observed variables are modeled as linear combinations of the factors. Factor analysis is related to principal
component analysis (PCA). However, unlike PCA that takes into account all variability in the variables, factor analysis 
estimates how much of the variability is due to common factors ("communality"). See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis.
